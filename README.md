# MDChecker

(c) GeoBretagne for the geOrchestra project

This is a simple quality assurance tool performing unit tests on dataset metadata stored in CSW-enabled catalsog.
Read [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) to get it work.
A docker image and a docker-compose file are provided to ease the deployment of this tool within containers.

[GeoBretagne](http://geobretagne.fr/) uses this tool to evaluate metadatas, quick fix errors, immediately see the result and keep an eye on the catalog global score.

This tool works well with [geOrchestra SDI](http://georchestra.org).
